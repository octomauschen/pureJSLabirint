# pureJSLabirint
Simple labirint scalable program. Just Ctrl+C => Ctrl + V and save all this code to your html-file to make it work (I know, that it's a bad practice). If you don't want to do even it, then visit my JSFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/VaAlina/njowxpbr/94/

You have to change css? to make it scalable! JS works fine!!!
